All code is of my own design, with the exception of the throttle function which is copied from the lodash library and the D3 library standard functions.

The Python notebook is also my work and can generate new art pieces.

The scrollytelly system was fully designed by me.

My main references were the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and D3 documentation sites.

Fonts are from Google Fonts.

###### Bugs
resources are in root directory because I couldn't get them to load from the data folder (something with Jekyll I believe)
